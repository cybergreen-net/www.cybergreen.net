Cyber Health Measurement
</h2>
The development and application of statistical methods to data allows for measurement of key indicators of malicious activity and risk conditions. These methods will provide analytical insight about patterns, priorities, and trends for action by the CERT/CSIRT community, and others.

Internet Scanning
</h2>
At CyberGreen, our work hinges on high quality, reliable data to enable us to provide the most accurate measurements and visualizations. CyberGreen scans the Internet to detect vulnerabilities that exist within the Cyber Ecosystem as they relate to open recursive servers. By conducting our own scans at CyberGreen, we can hold true to our value of transparency by devising our own scanning method and publishing that method for the broader community.

Providing a Clearing House for Mitigation
</h2>
The primary means for CyberGreen to enable the mitigation of cyber health risks is through the development and operation of the CyberGreen Platform. The Platform provides a mechanism for gathering data for metrics, to drive mitigation practices, and to provide tools for conducting statistical analysis.

Capacity Building
</h2>
CyberGreen will identify partners in the developing world, and provide the necessary training for participation in recognized risk mitigation and cyber health improvement efforts. The uniqueness of this capacity-building program is not only in providing training, but also providing actual data and tools to support continuous cleanup and hygiene-raising operations. CyberGreen metrics can provide a scoreboard for the effectiveness of efforts in targeted regions, or of specific projects.

Advocacy
</h2>
CyberGreen will strive to engage the policy-making and media communities as active participants in pursuing cyber health. We are working with partners to initiate a public awareness campaign to ensure that governments, businesses, the media, and individuals recognize the value of a healthy cyber ecosystem.
